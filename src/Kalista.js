			<b>Traits:</b> I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen. I ask a lot of questions.<br/><br/>
			<b>Ideals:</b> When I perform, I make the world better than it was. Tyrants must not be allowed to oppress the people.<br/><br/>
			<b>Bonds:</b> I would die to recover an ancient artifact of my faith that was lost long ago. I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.<br/><br/>
			<b>Flaws:</b> I'm a sucker for a pretty face. Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.<br/><br/>
