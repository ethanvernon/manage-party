			<b>Traits:</b> I settle for nothing less than perfection when it comes to combat. I have good manners but I eat like a pig.<br/><br/>
			<b>Ideals:</b> I swear to protect beings from evil so that they do not die before their time comes.<br/><br/>
			<b>Bonds:</b> The path to power and self-improvement is through knowledge. I hope to make a big beautiful graveyard in my old age.<br/><br/>
			<b>Flaws:</b> If there is a plan, I will forget it. I am thirsty for the blood of my enemies and have no mercy for those who stand against me, even if they are not evil.<br/><br/>
